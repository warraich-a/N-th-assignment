# N-th-assignment

The assignment is to: Use Google Firebase to build a Json REST API endpoint that allows a user to obtain the n-th
number in the Fibonacci sequence.And provide a frontend of your choice, that allows users to see what numbers were
previously requested at what time, and that is also hosted at Firebase.

In the free version of Google Firebase it was not possible to do that assignment, that is why I decided to use Django for backend restful api. And for front end I used Angular because Typescript is preffered by the company.
